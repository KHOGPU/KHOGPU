Khorium (codename KHOGPU) is a community-led project to create an fork of Bitcoin Gold which is a bitcoin fork.
The purpose for doing this is to make Bitcoin mining decentralized again.
Satoshi Nakamotoâ€™s idealistic vision of "one CPU one vote" has been superseded by a reality where the manufacture and distribution of mining equipment has become dominated by a very small number of entities, some of whom have engaged in abusive practices against individual miners and the Bitcoin network as a whole.
Bring the system back to the community with a ASIC-Resistant proof-of-work algorithm and a blockchain which starts from scratch.

The primary goal is to maintain a variant of Bitcoin that is more decentralized by using an ASIC-resistant Proof of Work algorithm, removing barriers to entry for new miners around the world and reducing the concentration of power in the hands of massive-scale mining operations.

Khorium preserves and implements Bitcoin features such as SegWit. Significant differences at launch time included:

- ASIC-resistant GPU-minable PoW algorithm (Equihash 144,5)
- Per-block difficulty adjustment algorithm
- Replay protection (SIGHASH_FORK_ID)
- Unique wallet addresses (prefixes of K and B)
